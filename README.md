<h1>Personal Blog</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This personal blog features an input form where users can input their username, title, and content for a new blog post. Upon submission, the entered data is saved to the local storage of the user's browser. This allows for the creation of a post that is persisted even after the browser is closed or refreshed.

Once a post is saved, it is dynamically displayed on the blog window, allowing users to immediately see their newly created content alongside existing posts. This seamless integration of input form and post display enhances the user experience, enabling quick and intuitive content creation and viewing.

In addition, the blog includes a convenient toggle button for switching between dark and light modes, providing users with customizable viewing options to suit their preferences and enhance readability in different environments.
